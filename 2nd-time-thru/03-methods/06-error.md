What does the following error message tell you?

```
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

You have a method called calculate_product that requires 2 arguments. You have only provided it 1, so an error is thrown.
