When you run the following code...

```ruby
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)
```

You get the following error message...
```
exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end
```

Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

It's in the error message! It's telling you it was expecting another use of the keyword `end`. It looks like we have an `if` statement within the `equal_to_four` method that is missing its own `end` statement. If we add another `end` to line 7, this runs without issue.
