Why does the following code...

```ruby
def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }
```

Give us the following error when we run it?

```
block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'
```

We didn't indicate that the argument is a block with `&`; as far as it's concerned, we didn't even pass an argument when calling the method.
