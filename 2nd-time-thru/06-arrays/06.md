You run the following code...

```ruby
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'
```

...and get the following error message:

```
TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

What is the problem and how can it be fixed? 

The error message is telling you that a String hasn't been converted into an Integer on line 2 in between square brackets. You are trying to use 'margaret' as an index for names, and replace it with 'jody', but that doesn't work! You'll need to instead refer to 'margaret' by its index, which is 3. You can fix it like this:

```
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names[3] = 'jody'
```
