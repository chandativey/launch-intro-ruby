Q: Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

A: Sure, hash values can be arrays as long as labeling isn't important. It might be confusing to see values without keys clarifying what they are though - for example if you had the test scores for students in a class, you could have an array of those scores, but wouldn't know who they belonged to. 
hash = {scores: [90, 100, 70]}

Yes, you can have an array of hashes:
scores = [{jessie: 90}, {andy: 100}, {cooper: 70}]

Given A: Yes

# hash values as arrays
hash = {names: ['bob', 'joe', 'susan']}

# array of hashes
arr = [{name: 'bob'}, {name: 'joe'}, {name: 'susan'}]

Comments after seeing given A: Oops, I didn't realize this didn't ask for why lol.
