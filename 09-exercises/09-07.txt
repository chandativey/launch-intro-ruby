What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

My answer: Hash order doesn't matter. Arrays don't have labels. 

Given answer: A hash contains a key value pair for referencing by key. 

Kind of correct? Since arrays don't have the labels, it addresses them not having key value pairs to reference by key.
